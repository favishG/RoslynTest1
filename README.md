# RoslynTest1
Combining roslyn assemblies

NOTE: This project is based on the code posted by "Nick Polyak" at stackoverflow "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37213781/compiling-classes-separately-using-roslyn-and-combining-them-together-in-an-asse/37239671" and also available at the roslyn site "https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/11297".

I did not make this code, I only did a visual stuio 2017 project to contain the original code submmited by "Nick Polyak" at stackoverflow in order to test it, and to share with him in order to ask for help because I can not make it work.

Thanks to Nick, now the code is working perfectly!!
I leave it here in case it could be useful for someone else.
